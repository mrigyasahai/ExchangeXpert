# ExchangeXpert
ExchangeXpert is a user-friendly currency converter app that provides real-time exchange rates for multiple currencies.

## Features

- Convert USD to any other currency
- Fetches live exchange rates using the OpenExchangeRates API (free to use)
- Easy-to-understand calculations for currency conversion
- Modular programming approach: each part of the app has its own module, making the code clean and organized.

## Future Updates

- I'm working on adding a feature where users can convert between any two currencies, not just USD.

## Video Progress

Here's a video showing the current progress of the app. Right now, it supports USD to any other currency conversion. More updates are coming soon!

## How It Works

1. **Fetches Currency Rates:** The app fetches live rates and currency data from the OpenExchangeRates API.
2. **Simple Calculations:** To convert currencies, the app does basic math using the fetched exchange rates.
3. **Modular Code:** Every function and process is organized into its own file, making it easy to maintain and improve the app over time.
